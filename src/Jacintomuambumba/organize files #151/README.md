## File Organizer - Codev

This is a simple file organization program developed by the Codev team. The program was created to help users organize their files into specific folders based on their extensions. The goal is to simplify the task of keeping your media files, such as music, photos, and videos, organized more efficiently.

### Key Features:

- **Organization by Extensions:** The program allows you to organize files based on their extensions. For example, music files (extensions .mp3) can be moved to a folder called "my music," while image files (extensions .jpg, .png) can be moved to a folder called "my pictures."

- **Unknown Extensions:** If an extension is not mapped to a specific folder, the program will move these files to a folder called "others."

### How to Use:

1. Run the program.
2. Select the source folder where your files are located.
3. Click the "Organize Files" button.
4. Wait for the program to organize the files into specific folders.

This program was developed in Python using the tkinter library for the graphical interface and the Pillow (PIL) library to handle images. It is intended to make file organization faster and more convenient, saving you time and keeping your files well-organized.
