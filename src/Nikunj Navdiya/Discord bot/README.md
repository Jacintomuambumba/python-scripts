# Getting a discord token

## Create a Discord Bot Application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and log in with your Discord account.

2. Click on the "New Application" button

3. Give your application a name and click "Create".

4. On the left sidebar, click on "Bot".

5. Click on "Add Bot" and confirm by clicking "Yes, do it!"

## Get the Bot Token

1. Under the Bot section, you will see a "Token" field. Click on "Copy" to copy your bot's token

2. Save this token somewhere safe! This is essentially your bot's password and should not be shared with anyone.

3. The token will be used later to log your bot in and connect it to Discord.

## Add the Bot to a Discord Server

1. To add your bot to a Discord server, you need to generate an invite URL

2. Under the "OAuth2" section, check the "bot" scope

3. Under "Bot Permissions", select any permissions your bot needs on the server.

4. The generated URL can now be used to add your bot to any Discord server.

That's it! Those are the basics steps to create a Discord bot application and get its token. The token can then be used with Discord.js or any other Discord API wrapper to login and connect your bot.
