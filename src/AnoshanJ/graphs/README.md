# Graph Algorithms in Python

- In this project, we have implemented the most used graph algorithms DFS - Depth first search and BFS - Breadth First Search in Python

### Firstly clone the repo
```

```
cd python-scripts/src/AnoshanJ/graphs
```

### Now execute the program using python3
```
python3 DFS.py
python3 BFS.py
```
